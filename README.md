The existing database will serve as a repository of public customer complaints filed against Comcast. It will help to pin down what is wrong with Comcast's customer

This project was completed as a part of assessment for Data Science with Python module. We used different Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib to complete the given analysis and visualization tasks

To perform these tasks, you can use any of the different Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib.

1) Import data into Python environment.
2) Provide the trend chart for the number of complaints at monthly and daily granularity levels.
3) Provide a table with the frequency of complaint types.
